// Build a trainCapacity variable and set it to 40. Then create a numPassengers
// variable and store the number 4 in it. Lastly, construct a string
// called occupancy in the following format:
//
//    "4 passengers present. with 36 seats remaining."
//
// In the console, use numPassengers to find the number of passengers
// on the bus, and use (trainCapacity - numPassengers) to find the number
// of seats remaining. Then log occupancy to the console.


const trainCapacity = 40
let numPassengers = 4
// let num = trainCapacity - numPassengers
console.log(`${numPassengers} passengers present. with ${trainCapacity - numPassengers} seats reaminig.`);


// console.log(numPassengers + " " + "passengers present. with "+ num + " " + "seats reaminig.");
