// Video 2.4 accompanies this exercise

// Use the same twenty20 variable, but change your variableâ€™s contents
// by reassigning it to the concatenation of the following characters:
//
// - The character at index 0 in "Never look back."
// - The character at index 3 in "Adventure is out there."
// - The character at index 14 in "Just keep swimming."
// - The character at index 1 in "To infinity... and beyond!"
//
// In the console, execute this concatenation in one line without
// declaring any extra variables. You can use a method to find the
// characters, or count very carefully. Then enter twenty20.

const n = "Never look back."
const a = "Adventure is out there."
const j = "Just keep swimming."
const t = "To infinity... and beyond!"
console.log(`${n[0]}${a[3]}${j[14]}${t[1]}`);
